## Waketech Github Projects

My name is Manav Prasanna Kumar and you can contact me at *manav.prasannakumar@gmail.com.* I am interested 
in astronomy and watching various space related videos in my free-time. I will use this website to help me 
learn how to use github and to make many interesting projects! I downloaded github desktop and then signed 
into my account which allowed me access to my previously made repository. I then cloned the repository 
from the main github website onto my personal laptop.

# About Me
## My Interests
I love watching infographic youtube channels like *Kurzgesagt â€“ In a Nutshell*. This channel teaches people about various scientific, technological, psychological, and philisophical subjects in an eye-catching and simple animation. I also like to look at the sky whenever I have the chance to see any interesting cloud trails or clouds as well as gazing at the Moon at night. I also love making presentations and digital posters for school projects and club activities!
